In the audio tag preload tag is bit confusing  so here it goes-
it Spacifies the audio should be loaded when the page loads 
it has few attributes------
1. none- this is the default values that indicates that video should not be loaded
2. METADATA- this value tells the browser to preload onlu the metadata of ythe audio file such as duration and basic information about the video
3. AUTO- this tag tells the browser to preload all the files as much as posiible without delaying the loading of the other important page content.
