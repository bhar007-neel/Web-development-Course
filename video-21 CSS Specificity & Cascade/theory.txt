Suppose we assign 2 background color to one paragraph at the same time, now which one will be given power to go first. lets learn that


so CSS has cascade alroithm, that determines whicvh property will apply.


4 rules-

  1. positon, order of appearence
so if they all are class selector, the one thats placed at the really end will win.
now what if we have id selector or element selector, then it ALL goes down to specifity, 
what is specifity???
it is a value, in terms which selector is most speciific...
Inline selector is considered more specific and then comes Id selector more specific.
example of inline selector---- in body -- in div--- <h1 style ="color:blue" class ="yellow cred cpurple"> </h1> </div>
so it will go for Blue without even thinking anything.
if this <h1 style = class ="yellow cred cpurple"> now depend on them how specific are them.
  
  Inline style>> id selector>> class or attribute selector>> element selector>> universal selector(this one is *)




         2. specificity





         3.origin ---- it comes browers style sheet(USER AGENT STYLE SHEET)





        4.importance ==== it u put (!important) then it is really important therefore CSS has to implement it.



        specificity calculation-- look online!!!
