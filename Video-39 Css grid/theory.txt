some additional tings to learn after going through grid oen and two
so the below code will take 80 view port and then distribute into 1fr 1fr 1fr
.container {
            width:80vw;
            border: 2px solid rgb(20, 20, 6);
            display: grid;
            grid-tempalte-coloumn:1fr 1 fr 1fr
            /*+gap :34px*/
            row-gap:10px
            coloum-gap-44px
        }
